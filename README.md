## Mario GAN: Generative Level Design for Mario Bros

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model designed to procedurally generate Super Mario Bros. levels. This model leverages sequential GANs to create cohesive and engaging level layouts with continuous and playable segments.

#### To Do

- Make our own dataset
- Create model architecture (OK)
- Train model with own dataset
- Create inference function with the sequential results
- Add playable/pathfinder enviorioment
